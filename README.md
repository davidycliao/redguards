This is a designed package for replicating the estimates and findings in the article of [**Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao's China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data**](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/redgaurds/master/paper/epsa.pdf). In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method as we called `SWORDFISH`  (Slogan-based Features Wordfish) that takes advantage of the facilitation of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative keywords (as known as noun collocation phrases) and scale those extracted text variables with Bayesian IRT Generalized Wordfish Model implanted by [Imai, Lo, and Olmsted (2016)](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/fastideal.pdf) based on the  Slapin and Proksch’s “Wordfish”(2008).

The Red Guard documents analyzed in the paper are archived in [The Databases for The History of Contemporary Chinese Political Movements](http://ccrd.usc.cuhk.edu.hk/Default.aspx?msg=%25u6ca1%25u6709%25u8ba2%25u9605%25uff0c%25u6b22%25u8fce%25u8ba2%25u9605%25uff01) (香港中文大學中國當代運動史數據庫) by The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Please note that replicating the analyses initially requires the access to the original corpus of the textual data. We, as authors and data users, do not fully have the copyright of the sources analyzed in the paper. To comply with the terms of service, we cannot share the textual files publicly.  However, we are providing pre-processed textual files parsed on CoNLL-U format and document-term-matrix to replicate the analyses of the last stage. The pre-processed textual materials can be found at [data](https://github.com/davidycliao/redguards/tree/master/data).

The source code in `replication-code` for replicating the estimates for this paper includes four parts: i) __tokenization and part-of-speech tagging on Universal Dependencies via pre-trained model__ (01.tokenization-in-udpipe.R) ; ii) __keyword extractions using TextRank__ (02.keywords-extraction.R); and  iii) __scaling documents via Wordfish on the extracted text features__ (03.pooled-ideal-point-estimates.R and 04.incident-ideal-points-estimates.R); finally, iiii) __visualizing estimates and ideal points__ (05.visualization.R).  

Replicating the comparable estimates for this paper is easy. Simply follow the description of [the reference](), folk or download this repo, and run `run_replication()` in the Rstudio console. The results and figures will automatically generated by the source codes and stored in `replication-figures`.

###### Note: The application of this estimation will be written independently as `SWORDFISH` package and released soon. 

<br />


## Getting started

Install the release version of [_R_](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (preferably version 3.6 or above),  [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and  `usethis` and `devtools` from CRAN with `install.packages(c("usethis", "devtools")) `.

```
install.packages(c("usethis", "devtools"))
library(usethis)
library(devtools)
```

Download the `redguards` repository from GitHub with `use_course` and tick Yes or Definitely, automatically bringing you to the redguards project.

```
usethis::use_course(create_download_url("https://github.com/davidycliao/redguards"))
```

Then, build the project package by `install()` and load it. 
```
devtools::install()
library(redguards)
```


Then, start replication with `run_replication()`. 
```
run_replication()
```

Please note that replicating the figures requires installing `STHeiti font` in local computer beforehand to present Chinese characters.
